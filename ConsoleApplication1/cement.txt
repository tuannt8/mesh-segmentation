# Segmentation parameter

shortest_edge: 5
smooth_coefficient: 0.6 # The higher the more straight curves
threshold_adapt_edge: 1 # The smaller, the smoother curves 
threshold_adapt_face: 0.01 # The smaller, the easier to capture all region

relabel: 1 # 0-1: Enable relabeling of triangle

time_step: 0.5
dsc_init_resolution: 10 # Edge length average, pixels

## The triangle labels will be initialied randomly
# number_phases_to_segment = 0 to disable initialization and
#	initialize it manually (In case we want single object segmentation without relabeling).
number_phases_to_segment: 3 

## Manual initialization if need
# Triangle near the point will be labeled
# Phase 1-9; 0 is the back ground
# Initialization with circle: [center.x center.y radius]
