     final argument is a boolean which indicates whether safe loading is used. This 
     argument defaults to true. Safe loading means that all the faces are loaded
     individually and then stitched in a second pass. 
     If safe is false, the faces are loaded and stitched at the same time, and this
     procedure cannot handle non-manifold situations. */
