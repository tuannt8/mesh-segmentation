     The arguments are the number of vertices (no_vertices),  the vector of vertices (vertvec),
     the number of faces (no_faces), a pointer to an array of double values (vert_vec) and an array
     of indices (indices).
     Note that each vertex is three double precision floating point numbers.
     The indices vector is one long list of all vertex indices. Note also that this function
     does not assume that the mesh is manifold. Each face is created independently and then stitched
     along the boundary with adjacent faces. This stitching will fail in non-manifold situations, but
     loading should always complete.  */
